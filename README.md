# Tycho Simulation

![Tycho Simulation](./assets/tycho-simulation.png)

Moves slow on-chain computations off-chain to solve optimization problems.

This crate allows simulating a set of supported protocols off-chain. Currently, it has a focus on token exchange
protocols, but it is not necessarily limited to this.
To get started, see our Quickstart guide [here](./examples/quickstart/Readme.md).

For complete documentation, see Tycho docs [here](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/for-solvers/simulation) and how
to integrate a new protocol [here](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/for-dexs/protocol-integration/simulation).
